# On-Track-A-Dive-Into-Renewable-and-Non-Renewable-Energy
Climate change is affecting the entire world. I wanted to take a look into how the top two energy producers are faring against the Paris Agreement. 

This project was cleaned in Excel, explored through SQL, visualized through Tableau, and presented in PowerPoint. For this project, I used the following data set between the years of 1990-2019(as data was incomplete for 2020) which can be found below:

I began my analysis focused on the top 10 countries from all around the world based off of their net installed energy capacity. I then decided to narrow my focus to the top two net installed energy producers, USA and China. 

To take a look at the full story through visualizations head to my Tableau Public page.
